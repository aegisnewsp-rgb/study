## Research Findings — 2026-04-05 10:42 UTC

### 🔴 Critical (fix immediately)
- **Schema domain mismatch in Layout.astro** — Organization and WebSite structured data used `studyroadmap.com` URLs while the live site is `studyroadmap.in`. The Organization `@id`, WebSite `url`, and SearchAction `urlTemplate` all pointed to `.com`. This prevents Google from correctly associating structured data with the canonical domain, hurting rich results and E-E-A-T signals.

### 🟡 Important (fix this cycle)
- Schema domain mismatch (see above) — FIXED in this cycle

### 🟢 Quick Wins (easy improvements)
- Site otherwise healthy: sitemap 3,352+ URLs ✅ | All key pages 200 ✅ | All schemas present ✅
- Plausible analytics still references `studyroadmap.com` on line 50 of Layout.astro — intentional (Plausible is registered for that domain) — left unchanged

### 📊 Traffic Opportunities
- Site fully healthy: sitemap ✅ (3,352+ URLs), all key pages 200 ✅, schemas valid ✅, hreflang ✅
- Schema fix now ensures Google correctly associates Organization + WebSite structured data with studyroadmap.in
- Remaining leverage: GSC verification (user needs to provide code), AdSense integration (user needs account), deploy service SSH fix

### ✅ Completed This Run
- Fixed Organization schema: @id + WebSite url + SearchAction urlTemplate → all now `studyroadmap.in`
- Commit 199842b — "Fix schema.org domain mismatch: all URLs now use studyroadmap.in"
- All 3 schema entities (Organization, WebSite, SearchAction) now match the canonical domain

### 🔴 Critical (fix immediately)
- None — site is healthy

### 🟡 Important (fix this cycle)
- None — all high-value SEO already implemented; remaining items need user input (GSC code, AdSense account, VPS SSH)

### 🟢 Quick Wins (easy improvements)
- News items 3 and 4 ("JEE topper ditched corporate for singing") are the same story from different sources (Hindustan Times, India Today) — same student, same angle. Not a bug per se (different URLs/sources), but the news filter could be smarter about "same headline + same context" dedup at the source level. Low impact — not changing anything.

### 📊 Traffic Opportunities
- Site fully healthy: sitemap ✅ (3352 URLs), all key pages ✅, schemas valid ✅, hreflang ✅
- Remaining leverage: GSC verification (user needs to provide code), AdSense integration (user needs account)

### ✅ Completed This Run
- Monitoring cycle: site healthy, news 10 items ✅, sitemap 3352 URLs ✅, exam pages /contact/ /exams/ all SEO-valid ✅
- No code changes (nothing actionable — all high-value improvements complete, pending user input for remaining items)
