# Research Log — StudyRoadmap Growth Research

## Research Run 1 | 2026-04-04 20:58 UTC

### Site Analysis Summary
- **Pages indexed:** 3,346 (sitemap confirmed)
- **Core SEO:** ✅ Excellent — OG, Twitter cards, FAQPage, HowTo, BreadcrumbList, Organization, WebSite+SearchAction all present
- **GSC verification:** ❌ `YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE` placeholder — NO DATA on Google search performance
- **Bing verification:** ❌ `BING_VERIFICATION_CODE` placeholder — NO DATA on Bing search performance  
- **Twitter App ID:** ❌ Missing mobile app IDs (Google Play, App Store) for better mobile sharing
- **hreflang:** ❌ None — India/Pakistan/Nigeria all English but no geo-targeting signals
- **ItemList schema:** ❌ /exams/ directory has NO ItemList schema — sitelinks opportunity missed

### 🔴 CRITICAL (needs user)
1. **GSC verification code** — without this, we are flying blind on Google search performance
2. **Bing verification code** — same for Bing Webmaster

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (implement now — no user needed)
1. **ItemList schema on /exams/** — captures Google sitelinks for the exams directory
2. **hreflang tags** — geo-target India (IN), Pakistan (PK), Nigeria (NG) for better regional ranking
3. **Twitter app meta** — `twitter:app:id:googleplay` + `twitter:app:id:appstore` for mobile sharing

### 🟢 QUICK WINS (easy, high impact)
1. **About page SEO** — add FAQPage schema to about.astro (it's thin on structured data)
2. **Contact page** — make sure it has proper meta tags (was just created)
3. **og-image.svg review** — ensure it looks good when shared (default OG template)

### 📊 Traffic Opportunities (keyword gaps)
1. "NEET study plan" vs "NEET UG exam" — current content optimised for exam info, not study plans
2. "how to prepare for NEET in 3 months" — HowTo schema could capture this featured snippet
3. "free study plan generator" — homepage could target this more explicitly
4. Pakistan-specific: "MDCAT preparation" vs "MDCAT date" — informational content needed
5. Nigeria-specific: "JAMB syllabus" vs "JAMB registration" — syllabus content strong, registration thin
